  <h1>CADDIES - CLS Abridged DDI Editor for Surveys - Help</h1>
  <h2>Generalities</h2>
    <p>
    This website edits survey metadata held in a relational database.
    <br/>
    The database schema (architecture) is based on the ddi3 xml schema.
    <br/>
    This means that duplication is held to a minimum and that editable fields for a given object
    are usually set by reference to objects in another table, in practice through menu options.
    </p>


  <h2>The questionnaire</h2>
    <p>
    The home page (questionnaire) lists the tables in a nested list format which corresponds approximately to
    the database schema with the outer nesting levels being dependent on the inner levels.
    To enter new material, the easiest way is to start at the bottom with the categories and gradually work your way up through the dependent tables.
    </p>

  <a id='ddi3instance'></a>
  <h2>DDI3 Instance</h2>
  <p>
  <b>Show</b> displays the top level information of the metadata set, the names of the building blocks of the xml schema.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Edit</b> is used to enter or edit this information.
  There are default values such as <em>xxx_inst01</em> where the <em>xxx</em> is to be replaced with a code specific to the metadata set being entered, e.g. <em>mcs5_inst01</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Xml compact</b> is the final outcome of this editor. It shows the metadata in ddi3.1 xml format.
  Xml compact only outputs the elements that are used in the top sequence, their children and their references.
  Use <em>right-click > Save Page as...</em> to save it to a file.
  As the page handles all the metadata, it may be relatively slow to load.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Xml library</b> shows the metadata in ddi3 xml format.
  In contrast to <em>xml compact</em>, it includes all the library-type elements, such as the question items or code schemes, whether they are used in the top sequence or not.
  <em>Xml library</em> may be used to output the intermediate stages of building a ddi3 instance file or to explicitely capture a question library or a code scheme set.
  Neither <em>xml compact</em> nor <em>xml library</em> includes the questionnaire components used in the attic.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Stats</b> displays some summary statistics on the metadata entered.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Qlist</b> outputs a question list for writing mapping files between questions and variables.
  It only uses the question components of the top sequence, in questionnnaire order.
  It outputs the name of the question component, the intent of the question item and the text of the question item.
  </p>

  <a id='spine'></a>
  <h2>Spine view</h2>
  <p>
  The spine view shows the questionnaire in tree-view format with components having a parent and children components reflecting the architecture of the questionnaire.
  Each component shows its spine id, its type (question, statement, sequence, loop or condition) and its name.
  </p>
  <p>
  Conditions have two child branches: the if-then branch which is followed if the condition is true and the else-then branch if the condition is false.
  </p>
  <p>
  The tree-view components are collapsible and right-clicking on the name accesses the <em>view</em> and <em>edit</em> page of the component.
  </p>
  <p>
  The attic is a scratchpad to help with editing. Its components are not included in the xml file, but the categories, code schemes, questions items are included as they may be used elsewhere.
  </p>

  <a id='categories'></a>
  <h2>Categories</h2>
    <p>
    Categories are the <em>choices</em> in the multiple-choice questions.
    If the same text or choice appears in more than one multiple-choice question, you only need to create a category once.
    </p>
    <h3>Listing and viewing categories</h3>
      The index page lists all categories by default or the results of the search option.
      Categories are deletable provided they are not used in any code scheme.
    <h3>Adding a new category</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Categories'.</li>
        <li>Check that the category does not already exist.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New category' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Category', enter your new label.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>Repeat for as many categories as required.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Editing a category</h3>
    <p>
      If you edit the text of a category, as it is used by reference, it will be changed in all the code schemes where it is used.
    </p>

  <a id='code_schemes'></a>
  <h2>Code schemes</h2>
    <p>
    Code schemes are the lists of multiple choices with their associated codes or values, e.g. <em>yes 1, no 0</em>.
    Again, you only need to create a code scheme once, even if it appears in more than one question.
    Code schemes are deletable provided they are not used in any code answer.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding a new code scheme</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Code Schemes'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New code scheme' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Code Scheme', enter your short description, for example the name of the question where it is used or <em>yesno</em> or <em>months</em>
          for the more generic code schemes.</li>
        <li>Select a category from the menu, add its value or code (1, 2, 3... or X, Y, Z...), click on <em>add to list</em>, repeat for all choices.</li>
        <li>Drag-and-drop the rows in the table if you want to change the order.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire.</li>
      </ul>

  <a id='response_domain_codes'></a>
  <h2>Code answers</h2>
    <p>
    Strictly speaking, as this is about the questionnaire, these are the options available for the question answers rather than the actual answers.
    Any of the answer types are deletable provided they are not used in any question item.
    </p>
    <p>
    For code answers, all that is required is to assign a code scheme to a new code answer.
    The code answer takes on the name of the code scheme.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding a new code answer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Code answers'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New Code answer' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Code answer', select the code scheme.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>A new linked entry in the table 'All Answers' is automatically created in the background.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire.</li>
      </ul>


  <a id='response_domain_datetimes'></a>
  <h2>Time and date answers</h2>
    <p>
    It is a good idea to create fairly generic time and date answers such as <em>date</em> or <em>duration in hours and minutes</em> as required by the questionnaire.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding a new time and date answer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Time and date answers'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New time and date answer' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New time and date answer', enter your new label.</li>
        <li>Select the type</li>
        <li>If the new domain is of type 'Duration', enter the format using the following description
          for example 'PTnnH' for duration in hours or 'PTnnHnnM' for duration in hours ands minutes.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>A new linked entry in the table 'All Answers' is automatically created in the background.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire.</li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
    <h4>ISO 8601 Duration (from DDI3.1 Technical Specification Overview)</h4>
    <p>
      Provides a duration of time represented by one of the following formats (specific format must be declared)
      PnnYnnMnnDTnnHnnMnnS where n is replaced with the number of unit types for example ‘P3Y6M4DT12H30M0S’
      defines ‘a period of three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and zero seconds’.
      Elements may be omitted if their value is zero. T is used to separate date and time elements
      so that P3M is 3 months and PT3M is three minutes.
      Alternative format P<date>T<time> ‘P0003-06-04T12:30:00’.
    </p>
    </blockquote>

  <a id='response_domain_numerics'></a>
  <h2>Numeric answers</h2>
    <h3>Adding a new numeric answer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Numeric answers'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New Numeric answer' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Numeric answer', enter required values.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>A new linked entry in the table 'All Answers' is automatically created in the background.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire.</li>
      </ul>

  <a id='response_domain_texts'></a>
  <h2>Text answers</h2>
    <p>
    The most commonly used set of text answers is: 'short text', 'long text' and 'null answer'.
    The latter is used for <em>header</em> questions which introduce more specific questions but which in themselves don't require any answer.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding a new text answer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Text answers'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New Text answers' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Text answers', enter your new maximum length.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>A new linked entry in the table 'All Answers' is automatically created in the background.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire.</li>
      </ul>

  <a id='question_items'></a>
  <h2>Question library</h2>
    <p>
    The question library contains question items which are made up of the text of a question and of the possible answers.
    They are to be thought of as context-free items which can then be used or instantiated in a questionnaire as part of a question component.
    </p>

    <h3>Listing the question items</h3>
    <p>
    The search box operates on the fields <em>Intent</em> and <em>Literal</em>.
    The question items are deletable provided they are not used in any question component no matter whether it is in the top sequence or in the attic.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding a new question item</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Question library (question items)'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New question item' at the bottom of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Question Item', fill required fields.</li>
        <li>Select one or more type of answer from the menu. You could for example have a numeric answer for a measure plus a code answer for 'refused/don't knows' or a code answer plus a text answer for the 'other, specify' selection.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Add to list' after each.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire.</li>
      </ul>

  <a id='universes'></a>
  <h2>Universes</h2>
    <p>
    The universes refer to the sub-sets of cohort members a question may apply to, for example <em>all cohort members</em> or <em>female cohort members</em>.
    </p>

  <a id='response_units'></a>
  <h2>Interviewees</h2>
    <p>
    The interviewees are the people answering the questions. For most questionnaires, 'Cohort member' is sufficient.
    </p>

  <a id='cc_sequences'></a>
  <h2>Sequences</h2>
    <p>
    With the questions, statements, loops and conditions, sequences are one of the questionnaire component types.
    They all follow a similar <em>list/show/edit/new</em> page pattern with a type-specific section and a generic component section.
    The easiest way to proceed, is probably to first enter the main sequences which correspond to the main sections of the questionnaire.
    An empty starter database contains the sequence <em>top sequence</em> which is the root or starting point of the questionnaire
    and <em>the attic</em> which is a scrachpad.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding a new sequence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Sequences'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New Sequence' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New sequence', fill the name field.</li>
        <li>The rest is about the position of the component in the questionnaire:</li>
        <li>Select the <em>parent</em>, which is an existing sequence, condition or loop component</li>
        <li>Tick on <em>if-branch</em> if the parent is a condition and if the component is in the <em>if-then</em> branch rather than the <em>else-then</em> branch.</li>
        <li>The position menu gives you a list of existing child-components in order to insert the new component at the right position.
          Nb: if this is not working in 'Internet explorer', try 'Firefox'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire or go to spine view.</li>
      </ul>

  <a id='cc_questions'></a>
  <h2>Question components</h2>
    <p>
    They are the questions as used in a questionnaire. In addition to the <em>question item</em> information, they have a specific position in the questionnaire,
    an interviewee and universes.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding a new question component</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Question components'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New Question Component' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Question Component', fill required fields.</li>
        <li>In the 'universes' menu, it is possible to select more than one universe and it is assumed that they are <em>and'ed.</em></li>
        <li>See the <em>sequence</em> instructions for parent and position selections.
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire or go to spine view.</li>
      </ul>

  <a id='cc_statements'></a>
  <h2>Statements</h2>
    <p>
    Statements are questionnaire components, i.e. they exist as a child-component of a sequence, loop or condition.
    (For statements inside questions, use the text field the question item).
    They have some text, but don't require an answer from the interviewee.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding a new statement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Statements'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New Statement' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Statement', fill the name and text fields.</li>
        <li>See the <em>sequence</em> instructions for parent and position selections.
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire or go to spine view.</li>
      </ul>

  <a id='cc_loops'></a>
  <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>
    Loops are for parts of the questionnaire which are repeated a fixed number of times or while a conditon is true.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding a new loop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Loops'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New Loop' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Loop', fill the required fields.</li>
        <li>See the <em>sequence</em> instructions for parent and position selections.
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire or go to spine view.</li>
      </ul>

  <a id='cc_ifthenelses'></a>
  <h2>Conditions</h2>
    <p>
    Conditions allow the questionnaire to fork depending on some condition statement which may be true or false.
    More commonly, it is used to only ask some question if the answer to the preceeding question makes it relevant.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding a new condition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>From the home page 'Questionnaire' go to 'Conditions'.</li>
        <li>Click on 'New Condition' at the top of the list.</li>
        <li>In 'New Condition', fill the required fields.</li>
        <li>See the <em>sequence</em> instructions for parent and position selections.
        <li>Click on 'Create'.</li>
        <li>Go back to questionnaire or go to spine view.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>
  For the user interface we replaced the ddi3-derived database terminology with more user-friendly descriptives.
  However, for power users the table below provides the mapping between the GUI names and the original ddi3 tags or database field names.
  The ddi3 terminology also appears in the urls of the pages.
    <br/>
    The translation of the xml schema to the database schema was done with the addition of generic 'wrapper' objects (questionnaire components, all answers)
    around the typed objects directly derived from the xml schema (sequences, text answers).
    This is what allows us to link and manipulate them in a uniform manner.
  </p>
